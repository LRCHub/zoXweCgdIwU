In the dark, you were swept away
And the world wouldn't let you stay
All the words that I want to say, I can't find

I am lost in remembering
Did you soar on an angel's wing?
Will your face keep on lingering
In my mind?

Oooooh
Hear me now
Oooooh ooooh
Oooooh
Hear me now
Oooooh ooooh

A part of me
Finds a hope in holding on
A part of me
Won't give up what isn't gone
A part of me
Wants to share the hurt and heartache
That I felt that day
When you took away
A part of me

Alana put a copy of your speech online
On the Facebook page for The Connor Project?
People started sharing it, I guess
And now it's, I mean, It's everywhere
People from all over the country
Yesterday Connor had 12 friends on here
How many does he have now?
1, 239
What happened?
You did.

I feel the weight of the world sink in
(Connor and I used to ride the same bus)
And the chills dance across my skin
(We were best friends in 4th grade)
(They were inseparable)
When I think how you must have been
(How you must have been)
So alone
(Our son went to school with Connor)

Oooooh
(He was my friend)
Hear me now
(I never met you, Connor, but coming on here,
Reading everyone's posts, it's so easy to feel alone)
(But right now, we're not alone. None of us)
(Thank you, Evan Hansen, for giving us a space to remember Connor)
Oooooh

Oooooh
(Thanks to Evan Hansen)
Oooooh
(We'll remember Connor)
Oooooh
(We'll always remember)

A part of me
Needs a way to say goodbye
A part of me
Now remembers how to cry
A part of me
Wants to share the hurt and heartache
So the world can see
That you'll always be
A part of me

You left this life
And left me numb
All were blind, and deaf, and dumb
We didn't know how bad it had become
Or how to save you
Now every prayer I've learned is prayed
And every moment shared replayed
I won't allow your memory to fade
Can I save you?
The sky collapsed without a sound
As broken pieces hit the ground
The rain fell down around me and I drowned
But I will save you
Our secret sorrows overflowed
I see them in your afterglow
I promise I will never let you go
I will save you

You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not,
You are not,
You are not alone

A part of me
Can't believe it's even real
A part of me
Doesn't know how much to feel
A part of me
Finds a rush within the pain
A part of me
Needs the feeling to remain
A part of me
Wants to share the hurt and heartache
So the world can see
That you'll always be

I think there's something you should know
You make me feel closer to him

A part of me
