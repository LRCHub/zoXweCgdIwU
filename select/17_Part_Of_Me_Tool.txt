Yeah, ready
I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
You are a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
Give it up
You don't speak
You don't judge
You can't leave, you
Can't hurt me
Just here for
Me to use
I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, better than one might think
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you well, you are a part of me
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time for you, to make a sacrifice
It's time to die a little, give it up
I know you best, better than any one
I know you better than I know myself
A part of me
