Get lost in my own way out
One tiny little thing I know
That you left me afraid
Now I drink, and I'm drained
This is how you work
A part of me, a part of you
It's my fault, that's what you said
It's my fault, that's what you said
A part of me, a part of you
It's my fault, that's what you said
It's my fault, that's what you said
A part of me, a part of you
